## Overview
The cryptocurrency market operates 24/7, making real-time data essential for tracking trends and making data-driven decisions. This pipeline automates data extraction from cryptocurrency APIs, processes and cleans the data, and stores it in a structured format for downstream analysis. Airflow orchestrates the tasks to ensure efficient and timely data flow.

## Features
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Pulls data from cryptocurrency APIs, storing the raw data for analysis.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and processes data to a standardized format for storage and analytics.
- **Data Storage**: Saves processed data in local storage with date-based versioning for historical analysis.
- **Orchestration with Airflow**: Automates and schedules the data pipeline with Airflow DAGs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large amounts of data and incorporate new sources or APIs easily.
